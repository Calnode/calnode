# Calnode — agent notes

Go backend (SQLite, `go:embed`s the built SvelteKit SPA) + SvelteKit 5 admin UI
served under `/admin/`. Public booking pages are server-rendered Go templates
(`internal/handler/templates/*.html`), distinct from the Svelte admin app.

## Frontend toolchain

- Vite 8 (Rolldown) · SvelteKit 2 · Svelte 5 · Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
  · bits-ui / shadcn-svelte · Vitest 4 browser mode.
- The frontend is embedded at Go compile time (`frontend/embed.go` →
  `//go:embed all:build`). To see frontend changes in the running app: rebuild
  the frontend (`pnpm build` in `frontend/`) **and** rebuild/restart the Go
  binary — restarting Go alone won't pick up new assets.

## UI styling — required check

shadcn-svelte components style state via Tailwind `data-*` variants. Bits-ui
states exposed as `data-state="…"` (checked/unchecked/open/closed) need an
`@custom-variant` remap in `frontend/src/app.css` or they render **silently
unstyled** (logic works, visuals don't). See `frontend/TESTING.md`.

**After changing `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/**`, `frontend/src/app.css`, or
the theme — run `pnpm test:visual`** (Vitest browser smoke). Unit tests do NOT
catch this class of bug; only the real-browser computed-style assertions do.

## Booking calendar — THREE surfaces, keep them aligned

The date/time-slot booking calendar exists in **three** places. A change to its
behaviour or markup must usually be made in all three, or they drift:

1. **Booking page** — `internal/handler/templates/book.html` (server-rendered Go template + vanilla JS)
2. **Manage page** — `internal/handler/templates/manage.html` (reschedule flow; same calendar/slots)
3. **Embed widget** — `internal/handler/embed.js` (Shadow-DOM Web Component on customer sites)

- **Styling is shared:** all three load `internal/handler/templates/booking.css`
  (served at `GET /booking.css`; the widget injects it into its shadow root). Change
  visuals **there**, once — don't re-style per surface.
- **Markup + JS are NOT shared** (Go template vs web component): the calendar render,
  slot picking, and the **mobile step-flow** (calendar → slots → form, with Back) are
  implemented separately in each. If you change calendar *behaviour*, update all three.
- Verify on **desktop and mobile** for each surface after touching the calendar.

## Conventions

- `pnpm` (not npm). Use `pnpm exec <tool>` for local binaries.
- Verify changes against the real app, not just builds — this codebase has been
  bitten by CSS that compiles fine but renders wrong.
